    <h1>EXERCISE</h1>

    <h3>
        Exercise is a body activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It is performed for
     various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills,
      weight loss or maintenance, improve health, or simply for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where 
      they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.

      <h1>CLASSIFICATION</h1>
<h3>
      1. Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than
       it would while resting. The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance. Examples of aerobic exercise
        include running, cycling, swimming, brisk walking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking, dancing, playing tennis, continuous
         training, and long distance running.
     2. Anaerobic exercise, which includes strength and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and increase muscle mass,
      as well as improve bone density, balance, and coordination. Examples of strength exercises are push-ups, pull-ups, lunges,
       squats, bench press. Anaerobic exercise also includes weight training, functional training, eccentric training, interval
        training, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training which increase short-term muscle strength.
    3. Flexibility exercises stretch and lengthen muscles. Activities such as stretching help to improve joint flexibility 
    and keep muscles limber. The goal is to improve the range of motion which can reduce the chance of injury.

    <h1>HEALTH EFFECTS</h1>
<h3>
    Physical exercise is important for maintaining physical fitness and can contribute to maintaining a healthy weight, regulating
     the digestive system, building and maintaining healthy bone density, muscle strength, and joint mobility, promoting physiological
      well-being, reducing surgical risks, and strengthening the immune system. Some studies indicate that exercise may
       increase life expectancy and the overall quality of life. People who participate in moderate to high levels of
        physical exercise have a lower mortality rate compared to individuals who by comparison are not physically active.
         Moderate levels of exercise have been correlated with preventing aging by reducing inflammatory potential.
